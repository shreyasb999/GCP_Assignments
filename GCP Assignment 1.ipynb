    "3. Hybrid cloud\n",
    "4. Community cloud\n",
    "5. Multi-cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us discuss them one by one:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Public Cloud :**\n",
    "\n",
    "The public cloud makes it possible for anybody to access systems and\n",
    "services. The public cloud may be less secure as it is open for everyone. The\n",
    "public cloud is one in which cloud infrastructure services are provided over\n",
    "the internet to the general people or major industry groups. The infrastructure in this cloud model is owned by the entity that delivers the\n",
    "cloud services, not by the consumer. It is a type of cloud hosting that allows\n",
    "customers and users to easily access systems and services. This form of\n",
    "cloud computing is an excellent example of cloud hosting, in which service\n",
    "providers supply services to a variety of customers. In this arrangement,\n",
    "storage backup and retrieval services are given for free, as a subscription, or\n",
    "on a per-use basis. Example: Google App Engine etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of the public cloud model:**\n",
    "* Minimal Investment: Because it is a pay-per-use service, there is\n",
    "    no substantial upfront fee, making it excellent for enterprises that\n",
    "    require immediate access to resources.\n",
    "* No setup cost: The entire infrastructure is fully subsidized by the\n",
    "    cloud service providers, thus there is no need to set up any\n",
    "    hardware.\n",
    "* Infrastructure Management is not required: Using the public\n",
    "    cloud does not necessitate infrastructure management.\n",
    "* No maintenance: The maintenance work is done by the service\n",
    "    provider (Not users).\n",
    "* Dynamic Scalability: To fulfill your company’s needs, ondemand resources are accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Private Cloud :**\n",
    "The private cloud deployment model is the exact opposite of the public cloud\n",
    "deployment model. It’s a one-on-one environment for a single user\n",
    "(customer). There is no need to share your hardware with anyone else. The\n",
    "distinction between private and public cloud is in how you handle all of the\n",
    "hardware. It is also called the “internal cloud” & it refers to the ability to\n",
    "access systems and services within a given border or organization. The cloud\n",
    "platform is implemented in a cloud-based secure environment that is\n",
    "protected by powerful firewalls and under the supervision of an\n",
    "organization’s IT department.\n",
    "The private cloud gives the greater flexibility of control over cloud\n",
    "resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of the private cloud model:**\n",
    "* Better Control: You are the sole owner of the property. You gain\n",
    "    complete command over service integration, IT operations,\n",
    "    policies, and user behaviour.\n",
    "* Data Security and Privacy: It’s suitable for storing corporate\n",
    "    information to which only authorized staff have access. By\n",
    "    segmenting resources within the same infrastructure, improved\n",
    "    access and security can be achieved.\n",
    "* Supports Legacy Systems: This approach is designed to work\n",
    "    with legacy systems that are unable to access the public cloud.\n",
    "* Customization: Unlike a public cloud deployment, a private\n",
    "    cloud allows a company to tailor its solution to meet its specific\n",
    "    needs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Hybrid cloud :**\n",
    "By bridging the public and private worlds with a layer of proprietary\n",
    "software, hybrid cloud computing gives the best of both worlds. With a\n",
    "hybrid solution, you may host the app in a safe environment while taking\n",
    "advantage of the public cloud’s cost savings. Organizations can move data\n",
    "and applications between different clouds using a combination of two or\n",
    "more cloud deployment methods, depending on their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of the hybrid cloud model:**\n",
    "* Flexibility and control: Businesses with more flexibility can\n",
    "    design personalized solutions that meet their particular needs.\n",
    "* Cost: Because public clouds provide for scalability, you’ll only\n",
    "    be responsible for paying for the extra capacity if you require it.\n",
    "* Security: Because data is properly separated, the chances of data\n",
    "    theft by attackers are considerably reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Community cloud :**\n",
    "It allows systems and services to be accessible by a group of organizations. It\n",
    "is a distributed system that is created by integrating the services of\n",
    "different clouds to address the specific needs of a community, industry, or\n",
    "business. The infrastructure of the community could be shared\n",
    "between the organization which has shared concerns or tasks. It is generally\n",
    "managed by a third party or by the combination of one or more organizations\n",
    "in the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of the community cloud model:**\n",
    "* Cost Effective: It is cost-effective because the cloud is shared by\n",
    "    multiple organizations or communities.\n",
    "* Security: Community cloud provides better security.\n",
    "* Shared resources: It allows you to share resources,\n",
    "    infrastructure, etc. with multiple organizations.\n",
    "* Collaboration and data sharing: It is suitable for both\n",
    "    collaboration and data sharing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**5. Multi-cloud :**\n",
    "We’re talking about employing multiple cloud providers at the same time\n",
    "under this paradigm, as the name implies. It’s similar to the hybrid cloud\n",
    "deployment approach, which combines public and private cloud resources.\n",
    "Instead of merging private and public clouds, multi-cloud uses many public\n",
    "clouds. Although public cloud providers provide numerous tools to improve\n",
    "the reliability of their services, mishaps still occur. It’s quite rare that two\n",
    "distinct clouds would have an incident at the same moment. As a result,\n",
    "multi-cloud deployment improves the high availability of your services even\n",
    "more.\n",

    "**Advantages of a multi-cloud model:**\n",
    "* You can mix and match the best features of each cloud provider’s\n",
    "    services to suit the demands of your apps, workloads, and\n",
    "    business by choosing different cloud providers.\n",
    "* Reduced Latency: To reduce latency and improve user\n",
    "    experience, you can choose cloud regions and zones that are close\n",
    "    to your clients.\n",
    "* High availability of service: It’s quite rare that two distinct\n",
